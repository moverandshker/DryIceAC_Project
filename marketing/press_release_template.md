**Eco-Friendly Technology Offers Superior Cleaning While Reducing Energy Costs**

**EDMONTON, ALBERTA – [LAUNCH DATE] –** A revolutionary new air conditioning cleaning service has arrived in Edmonton, offering homeowners a chemical-free alternative that can reduce energy costs by up to 20%. [COMPANY NAME] introduces dry ice blasting technology for residential AC cleaning – a method previously reserved for industrial applications that delivers superior results without harmful chemicals.

With Edmonton experiencing increasingly warmer summers due to climate change, air conditioner usage continues to rise across the city. Regular maintenance is crucial for these systems, but traditional cleaning methods often involve harsh chemicals that can impact indoor air quality and the environment.

[COMPANY NAME]'s dry ice blasting service uses solid carbon dioxide (CO₂) pellets that sublimate on impact, leaving no secondary waste and effectively removing dirt, mold, and contaminants from even the most delicate AC components.

"Our service represents a significant advancement in how Edmonton homeowners can maintain their AC systems," says [FOUNDER NAME], founder of [COMPANY NAME]. "Not only does it deliver a superior clean that can reduce energy consumption by up to 20%, but it's also completely chemical-free and environmentally friendly."

The innovative cleaning method offers multiple benefits:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Thoroughly cleaned coils can reduce energy consumption by 15-20%
- **Extended Equipment Lifespan**: Proper maintenance can add 2-3 years to an AC unit's life
- **Improved Indoor Air Quality**: Removes allergens and contaminants without introducing chemicals
- **Environmental Responsibility**: Chemical-free process with no secondary waste stream
- **Superior Results**: Cleans areas traditional methods can't reach

With air conditioner installation costs in Edmonton averaging $4,545, homeowners are increasingly focused on protecting their investment through proper maintenance.
