### ABOUT DRY ICE CLEANING

**Q: What exactly is dry ice cleaning?**

A: Dry ice cleaning uses solid carbon dioxide (CO₂) pellets that are accelerated through a specialized blasting system and directed at surfaces needing cleaning. On impact, the pellets sublimate—turning directly from solid to gas—creating a micro-thermal shock that breaks the bond between the contaminant and the surface. This process effectively removes dirt, grime, mold, and other particles without leaving behind any secondary waste.

**Q: Is dry ice cleaning better than traditional AC cleaning methods?**

A: Yes, for several reasons. Traditional cleaning methods often use water and chemicals, which can damage sensitive components and leave residue. Dry ice cleaning is:
- Non-abrasive and safe for delicate components
- Chemical-free, making it environmentally friendly
- More thorough, reaching areas difficult to clean with manual methods
- Waste-free, as the dry ice sublimates into the air
- More effective at removing biofilms and contaminants

**Q: Is dry ice cleaning new technology?**

A: The technology has been used in industrial applications for decades, particularly in aerospace, automotive, and food processing industries. What's new is our application of this premium technology to residential AC systems in Edmonton. We're bringing industrial-grade cleaning performance to homeowners.

### BENEFITS & RESULTS

**Q: How much can dry ice cleaning improve my AC's energy efficiency?**

A: Properly cleaned AC components can reduce energy consumption by 15-20% compared to dirty systems. The U.S. Department of Energy and various HVAC industry studies have confirmed that even a small layer of dirt on cooling coils can significantly reduce efficiency. Our cleaning process removes these barriers to efficient operation.

**Q: Will I notice a difference in my home's air quality?**

A: Many customers report improved air quality after our service. When your AC unit is clean, it's not circulating dust, allergens, or potential mold spores through your home. This is particularly noticeable for households with allergy sufferers or respiratory sensitivities.

**Q: How much money can I save with your service?**

A: The average Edmonton home spends approximately $166 on air conditioning during the cooling season. A clean system that's 15-20% more efficient could save you $25-$33 per season. Additionally, proper maintenance extends your system's lifespan, potentially saving thousands in premature replacement costs. With AC systems averaging $4,545 to replace, extending your unit's life by even a year or two represents significant savings.
